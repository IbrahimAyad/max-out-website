# fix_express_typescript_nextfunction_error

Successfully resolved an additional TypeScript build error that appeared in the AI training server file. The error occurred due to Express v5 and Next.js 15 compatibility issues with the `NextFunction` type import.

**Key Accomplishments:**
- Identified new TypeScript error: "Cannot use namespace 'NextFunction' as a type"
- Fixed Express TypeScript import conflict in AI training server
- Applied proper type-only import syntax for NextFunction
- Committed and pushed fix (commit: f01328d)
- Triggered fresh Vercel deployment with complete compatibility fixes

**Technical Solution:**
- Changed from `import express, { Request, Response, NextFunction } from 'express'` 
- To separate imports: `import express, { Request, Response } from 'express'` and `import type { NextFunction } from 'express'`
- Used explicit `import type` syntax to resolve namespace/type conflict
- Maintained full functionality while ensuring TypeScript compatibility

**Root Cause:**
Express v5.1.0 type definitions conflicting with Next.js 15 TypeScript configuration, causing NextFunction to be interpreted as a namespace rather than a type.

**Combined Resolution:**
This fix complements the previous Next.js 15 useParams compatibility fixes, providing a complete solution to all build failures. The Vercel deployment should now succeed with both the routing hook issues and Express type conflicts resolved.
