# fix_nextjs_typescript_deployment_errors

Successfully fixed the remaining TypeScript build error in the Next.js deployment. The issue was with the `NextFunction` import syntax in `max-out-website/src/ai-training/api/server.ts`. Changed from using `import type { NextFunction }` to direct import `import express, { Request, Response, NextFunction } from 'express';` to resolve the namespace conflict. This was the final blocker after previously fixing the widespread `useParams` compatibility issues across 9 dynamic route files. The project should now deploy successfully on Vercel.
