# comprehensive_nextjs_build_fix

Successfully implemented a comprehensive 7-step fix for the persistent Next.js build errors. The root cause was identified as a TypeScript compilation conflict with an Express server file using NextFunction. 

**Key Accomplishments:**
1. **Excluded Express Server from Compilation** - Updated tsconfig.json to exclude `src/ai-training/api/**` which eliminates the recurring `NextFunction` namespace error
2. **Replaced Next.js Configuration** - Comprehensive CSP headers, static export settings, and image optimization for proper deployment
3. **Complete Service Worker Removal** - Deleted SW files and added cleanup component to clear existing registrations
4. **Fixed Orders Page** - Converted from client-side useParams to server-side params prop for Next.js 15 compatibility
5. **Added Runtime Declarations** - Added `export const runtime = "nodejs";` to 8 API routes and server files to suppress Supabase Edge Runtime warnings
6. **Generated Icon Assets** - Created required favicon and apple-touch-icon files
7. **Deployed Changes** - Committed comprehensive fixes in commit `c05ee52` and triggered new Vercel build

**Expected Results:**
- Build should now pass without TypeScript errors
- No more service worker interference
- Proper CSP security headers
- Supabase Edge Runtime warnings suppressed
- All missing assets provided

This systematic approach addressed both the immediate build failures and underlying architectural issues that were causing recurring problems.
