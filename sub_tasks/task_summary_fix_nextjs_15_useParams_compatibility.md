# fix_nextjs_15_useParams_compatibility

Successfully identified and resolved Next.js 15 compatibility issues across multiple files in the project. The root cause was widespread use of the incompatible `useParams` hook from `next/navigation` which is not available in Next.js 15.

**Key Accomplishments:**
- Fixed 9 files that were using the problematic `useParams` import
- Replaced all instances with `usePathname` and manual URL parsing logic  
- Applied consistent fix pattern across all dynamic route pages
- Committed changes and pushed to main branch (commit: 6c9584f)
- Triggered fresh Vercel deployment with compatibility fixes

**Technical Solution:**
- Replaced `import { useParams } from "next/navigation"` with `import { usePathname } from "next/navigation"`
- Updated parameter extraction from `params.paramName` to `pathname.split('/').pop()`
- Maintained existing functionality while ensuring Next.js 15 compatibility

**Files Fixed:**
- orders/[orderId]/page.tsx
- occasions/[occasion]/page.tsx  
- products/tuxedos/[id]/page.tsx
- products/dress-shirts/[id]/page.tsx
- products/ties/[id]/page.tsx
- products/category/[category]/page.tsx
- bundles/[id]/page.tsx
- collections/dress-shirts/[color]/page.tsx
- collections/ties/[color]/page.tsx

The Vercel build should now succeed, resolving the deployment failure that was blocking the website update.
